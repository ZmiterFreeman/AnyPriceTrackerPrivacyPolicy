  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last update:</strong> April 25, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Application ("we", "our", or "the App") handles user data. It applies to the current version of the App published on Google Play.</p>

  <h2>1. Personal Data Collection</h2>
  <p>The App <strong>does not collect</strong> personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, phone number, or address.</p>
  <p>There are no forms for registration, login, or user profile creation.</p>
  <p>If you voluntarily contact the developer via email, your email address and message content will only be used to respond to your inquiry and <strong>will not be shared</strong> with third parties.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collected Automatically</h2>
  <p>The App uses third-party services to help improve stability and user experience:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong><br>
      Collects crash logs to help identify and fix bugs.<br>
      Data includes device model, OS version, and technical crash details.<br>
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Amplitude Analytics</strong><br>
      Collects anonymized usage statistics (e.g., screen views, button clicks) for analytics and product improvement.<br>
      No personal content or identifiers such as name or email are collected.<br>
      <a href="https://amplitude.com/privacy" target="_blank">Amplitude Privacy Policy</a>
    </li>
    <li><strong>WebView</strong><br>
      The App allows users to open third-party websites. These websites may collect their own data as per their respective privacy policies.<br>
      The App itself does <strong>not process or store</strong> any content from those pages, except for the URL and technical CSS selectors explicitly saved by the user.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Permissions Used</h2>

      <td>Foreground/background access</td>
      <td>Required to periodically check for updates on saved pages.</td>

      <td>Storage (if applicable)</td>
      <td>May be used to temporarily store minimal technical data such as saved URLs and selectors. No media or files are accessed.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>All transmitted data (e.g., analytics, crash logs) is encrypted in transit using HTTPS. No sensitive user data is stored on our servers.</p>

  <h2>5. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
